# Project plan

## Language evaluation

The three main goals and their deliverables for this language are as follows:
  * Develop plan and start usage of a graphics engine for the simulation
      * Pick a graphics engine
      * Demonstrate knowledge of the api/development aspects that can connect to my language. 
  * Develop a syntax that accurately represents the ideas from labanotation 
      * Should have the ability to represent the different elements: direction/level, body parts, movement duration, and dynamic quality
  * Develop an intermediary connection between the graphics engine and the new syntax
      * Have at least a prototype of how this sort of movement could be displayed through the graphics engine
      * Start the process of translating between the syntax and the coding that produces the 3d animation

To evaluate my language design, I will check to make sure it meets all of the requirements listed above. I will also check for characteristics like readability, not being overly verbose, and accurately translating to the simulation. To ensure that the language is high quality, I will make sure that it has opportunites to be extended. I also will try to do some user testing. It would be most effective to test with people with already know something about labanotation, though I'm sure I could still learn something from users who are non-familiar. 


## Implementation plan

In order to complete this project on time, I propose the following timeline.
