Since I didn't get to the critique in time for last week, more focusing on the work you did this last week. First of all, congrats on 
the MVP! It's really exciting that you've gotten this basically working. Also, I'm glad you put in the time to add those error 
messages this past week. Those will be very helpful to users. 

As for syllables, I personally don't think that's super necessary. I think trying to specify something like that in CL sounds like a 
nightmare as a user, honestly. If you were to make a more GUI-based language to interact with, however, it might be worth considering
then. There would easier ways to implement it (clicking buttons, drop down menus, scroll wheels, etc). Maybe I'm not being creative 
enough, but most of the ways I can think of to do so in CL seem cumbersome.

You ask about syntax-- do you have an example program written up anywhere? Looking through your project repository, it was not easy 
to quickly find what it looks like right now, and I'm not sure if you've made any/many changes since the last iteration that I've seen. 
From what I remember, I found your syntax easy enough to read, but I'm not sure if it could be geared better towards your target audience.
Have you had a chance to show it to a elementary schooler or middle schooler? You might be able to ask one of the professors here if you 
could borrow their child for a few minutes...
