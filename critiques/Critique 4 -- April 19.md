You bring up an interesting problem with your data format. I can completely sympathize with the "list of lists of attributes" problem and how hard it is to track/debug. This advice isn't very relevant because you're using Prolog, but my first instinct towards solving that problem is to make your list items into objects. That way the attribute list format is constrained within objects. It's much easier to debug lists of objects than lists within lists. I don't know if there's something similar in Prolog that you could use to represent classes in a more efficient format. After some quick searching, I found [Logtalk](http://logtalk.org/), an extension to Prolog that allows some object-oriented functionality. It sounds like you can simulate objects in Prolog with modules, so that could be something worth looking into in the last week.

A large portion of your project notebook talked about the error that you were having with duplicate schedules. I know that you got this error working in class on Monday, so I will not spend a lot of time suggesting more solutions to that. My initial proposal was for you to look at list and set manipulation in Prolog to try and either add possible schedules to a set or to try and eliminate duplicates in your list. This still doesn't solve the efficiency problem, since you would be parsing through all potential schedules and then eliminating duplicates. I know it's working now, so I'll talk about something else we discussed in class. I mentioned that classes at the same time on the same day might cause a problem (since your issue of multiple schedules was caused by class conflicts on different days). Based on your reaction, it seemed like something you still needed to implement in the language so here's a reminder!

From a UI standpoint, I really like the format in which you are printing the potential schedules. I don't think you have to do much work on the output side of the project. As for the input, I really like your idea of reading the class schedule list from a text file. That way the user doesn't have to copy and paste the giant Scheduler list directly into Prolog. It also enables them to save multiple potential schedules as text files and load them in without having to re-download their preferences online. I'm trying to think about additional modificaitons that could be made to the user experience within the next week. At the very least, you could let the user split their ratings into multiple lines. Perhaps you could add something to the setPreferences clause so that it continues to accept constraints (the user puts in `rateProf('Van Hecke', 10)`, presses enter, and can put in additional constraints) until the user inputs a blank line. This could let the user separate the constraints visually. Another option could be letting the users write out their constraints in a separate text file and reading it in similarly to the class lists. That might be convenient for people who have several possible constraint sets that they want to test against potential schedules.
