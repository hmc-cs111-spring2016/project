I agree with Andrew that a scope including all heroes would be too much. However, now that you're constricted to the space of just carries, you may want to consider improving your DSL to do more advanced operations that you definitely wouldn't have been able to do before. For instance, I previously brought up automating the process of exploring builds by optimizing a user-defined function. While I am less familiar with Dota than you and Andrew, I feel like calculating stats based on specific items may be too easy depending on how advanced your win chance system is (which could get really advanced really fast). Otherwise I feel like helping users find their best build will be very important to them, which will require considering a wide variety of possible builds (either for their hero, the hero they're facing, or both).

Also, hardcoding values yourself, while acceptable early on, isn't ideal in the long run. Let me know if the CSV file I sent you will be sufficient for your purposes. For future referece, I was able to save and open the Google Doc normally when you emailed it to me, even though it was just a link to someone else's. Once I was able to open it like a normal Google Doc, I was able to download the CSV under the File menu. If you really like JSON or another format, it would probably be worth the effort of finding a program to convert it for you.
