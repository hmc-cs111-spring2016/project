I agree with Andrew that a scope including all heroes would be too much. However, now that you're constricted to the space of just carries, you may want to consider improving your DSL to do more advanced operations that you definitely wouldn't have had time to do before. For instance, I previously brought up automating the process of exploring builds by optimizing a user-defined function. This would allow users to help prioritize builds that fit well with their play style. If you were really ambitious, you might try to extract this kind of information from gameplay data (e.g. mouse clicks, previous builds, etc.). While I am less familiar with Dota than you and Andrew, I feel like calculating stats based on specific items may be too easy depending on how advanced your win chance system is (which it looks like you've already made quite a bit of progress on). Another useful feature might be exploring enemy builds that would counter your build and how to make your build as well-rounded as possible (by finding a build that has the highest minimum chance of success against all other builds).

Also, hardcoding values yourself, while acceptable early on, isn't ideal in the long run. Let me know if the CSV file I sent you will be sufficient for your purposes. For future referece, I was able to save and open the Google Doc normally when you emailed it to me, even though it was just a link to someone else's. Once I was able to open it like a normal Google Doc, I was able to download the CSV under the File menu. If you really like JSON or another format, it would probably be worth the effort of finding a program to convert it for you as having detailed, complete, and up-to-date item information will be relevant to your DSL's users.

Finally, one thing that I'd like to know more about is how you calculate the chance of one build winning over another. I feel like this is not very straightforward and would not be easy without some pretty strong assumptions that would likely make your conclusions meaningless. If it's not clear which is best, I feel like this would be yet another reason to implement optimization of user-defined functions. This would allow your DSL to help adapt to different playstyles (for instance, some players may prefer carries with high burst damage while others may pefer tankier ones with higher sustained DPS).

I'd also like to add that I looked through your code and it generally looks pretty good. I'm still debating whether it's really worthwhile to modify your object in `add_item` or to just generate a new object with the new set of items. With the second option, you wouldn't need to maintain any code for figuring out the different between your current stats and the ones after adding the new item (which could simplify your codebase a bit). Anyway, it looks like you're making good progress towards your current goal. However, given the time you spent making that progress, it might not be worth bothering with optimization until you've gotten everything else in order.
