# Response to your notebook questions

You expressed some concern about reworking your intermediate representation, but I'm not totally sure what your representation is right now, aside from stuff in pydub which is sort of a back-end anyway. Regardless, I don't think you'd need to do a complete overhaul of anything to get all the functionality you want/need. I think the thing that makes the most sense as far as methods/classes goes would be to give each effect a class, and the things you can do to the effect are the
methods of those classes. So, you might add volume objects to your intermediate representation, and when "+ volume 20" gets called, you call a + method from a volume object. I wasn't the one to suggest this so I don't have a super specific idea of how the architecture would work out, but I imagine that you'd have some top-level class for editing a file, and that would have an object for each effect.

If I understand correctly, by "incorporate the array of different sound files in the intermediate representation," you mean something along the lines of storing the modified version of the original file as you go. If I do understand correctly, I have an idea that might be easier to work with (although for all I know it would actually be harder to implement, I'm not the one working with your backend). Since the point of that seems to be facilitating the undo feature,
rather than storing all the modified versions of the original file, just store the original and whatever you've gotten from all the modifications so far. Then, keep some kind of undo history that tells you what the last n modifications were. If all possible modifications are reversible (in the sense that you don't lose information when you perform them), then to undo you look at the last modification and do the opposite of it to your modified version of the file. If some modifications do
lose information, then if you still want to undo those one option is to throw out the modified version of the file, and just take the original and perform in order all the modifications you made prior to the one to undo.
