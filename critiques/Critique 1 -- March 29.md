I think the idea is solid - it's very important that you have your target audience so well-delineated. I think you'll need to keep that at the front of your mind as you develop the language. Make sure at every step that the syntax, the interface, etc are things that that middle schoolers would understand and want to use. 

There are some challenges to think about with that in mind. One is syntax - although the actual syntactic component of your language seems pretty minimal (just the meter and rhyme scheme specification) it's important that you get the way that meter and rhyme are specified right so that it's intuitive to use. Rhyme is probably pretty simple but if you get to specifying meter it might be trickier. For the rhyme scheme remember what we talked about with regard to regular expressions - you might want to think about whether or not you want to take advantage of them, or whether star is intuitive, or whether you'd rather just make it the default that rhyme schemes repeat or something like that.

The form that you report mistakes in is also something you'll need to think about - if you have something like an ABAB scheme and lines 1 and 3 don't rhyme, then you wouldn't just want to say "incorrect on line 3" because line 1 might be incorrect. You might want to give some message like "X does not rhyme with Y" where those are the words on the ends of the lines. You could also potentially return "warnings" or something like that for weak rhymes, or let the user specify if they want exact rhyme. It's a potential tradeoff between complexity and power. Error reporting might be similar - if you get an empty JSON from an API call that might indicate a typo, and you could report it in many different ways. It looks like you're thinking about these kinds of things already.

I'm not really familiar with development dependent on an API or good practices, but I'll be sure to share anything that I learn in my own project. Test-driven development is definitely a good idea for you especially since your language lends itself nicely to unit testing. A prototype might be something like checking a text file for some specific rhyme scheme, and then you can generalize it by allowing the user to specify their rhyme scheme.

It seems like you have a pretty good idea overall of what you want to do. I think so long as you keep your target audience in mind at every major decision you should be able to make a good tool.
