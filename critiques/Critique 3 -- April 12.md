To the graders: Hannah and I talked and because she had not gotten much work done, and she wanted me to discuss things that I would want from her DSL as a user.

I guess, with something as complicated as Labanotation seems to be, I would want some sort of understanding of what the default settings are. I know that there are all sorts of things that can be done with Labanotation, such as spinning, moving certain parts of the body, speed, and many more things. Thus, if I just say "move left", what doest that mean? Which body part moves? How far? for how long? Are these defaults something that you want to allow the user to change? And so on. I think I would want really clear and intuitive answers to these questions.

There aren't too many things discussed that we didn't talk about in our last meeting, but I think another thing to consider is errors/order of operations. What actions have precedence over other actions? I think the one thing that I'm most concerned about now is that the state space of possible options is incredibly large, as we saw in the textbook you showed us, and as such some logical ordering is super important. I think eventually a GUI would make this easier to understand as a user, but it is still important from an IR standpoint.

I think syntax is less important, because a GUI would probably be the best way to interact with the language; I am wondering about the rendering of animations though. Is this something that you care about in the scope of this project? If so, I'm wondering just what level of depth you plan to get to here, and how easy it is to work with the libraries you choose. Of course, the goal is to show the user the end product of their "labanotation" designs, but I don't know if getting good animations is necessarily of high importance. (as you can see, I'm kind of just rambling my thoughts about your project at this point)

I think as a user, another thing I'd want to be able to do is describe my set of actions as a list. for example, for action A, I want the body moving left and down with the right foot moving right and the hands going behind the head. What's the best way to say that? I'm not totally sure. I think these types of example commands could be really helpful in guiding the data structures you use, as well as the ordering/priority given to various commands.

I'm really excited to see what you come up with!
