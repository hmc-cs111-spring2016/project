I think that you have a very interesting project idea. I've had the painful experience of writing impossibly long SQL queries. They're difficult to debug and even if they work, it's hard to review them and remember your initial logic. 

I think you'll run into some interesting problems to tackle over the course of your project. For example, are you planning on translating each entry in a database into a corresponding Scala object and then querying those objects like a collection? That's one possible approach, though I don't think it would be time-efficient since you would need to parse the entire database. You may already have a solution you're pursuing, but take that suggestion as a reminder to consider all your options before jumping in with one approach. 

It seems like you have reasonable expectations for the scope of the project. I'm glad that you acknowledged the fact that there are some database errors you might need to worry about. Can you think of any cases in the scope of your project where you'd run into concurrency issues? I know you said you weren't going to deal with those, which I think is definitely reasonable given the project timeline. However, I'm curious whether that might become an unexpected issue in testing, depending on how frequently you modify your test database. It's a good thing to keep in mind as a potential source of error while you test your system.

I think that you have a very extensible project and a good timeline given the nature of your project. Once you get your initial function working, you have the freedom to pick and choose the different SQL/Scala Collections functionality you want to implement. I'm still concerned about how the initial function will work. It's a good idea to be aware of space constraints and efficiency in reading from your database. I also wonder how it will work for complex databases (ones where the attributes have odd types, etc). It seems like Slick is a great reference for any issues. 

Other than that, something to keep in mind is ways to extend, change, or improve the project. I think it's important to discuss this in critique group for all our projects so that we remain open to new possibilities. My preliminary stab at answering this question for you would be to think about different user interfaces. You're talking about making SQL queries in Scala. What if you restructured the Scala Collections queries so that someone using the filter collection could say `filter all where id > 10`. That would make your language a sort of Scala/SQL hybrid capable of implementing the functionality in Scala Collections. Again, I'm not saying that's better or worse than what you have now but it's something to consider.
