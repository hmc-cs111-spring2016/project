# Project plan

## Language evaluation

The three main goals and their deliverables for this language are as follows:
  * Develop plan and start usage of a graphics engine for the simulation
      * Pick a graphics engine
      * Demonstrate knowledge of the api/development aspects that can connect to my language. 
  * Develop a syntax that accurately represents the ideas from labanotation 
      * Should have the ability to represent the different elements: direction/level, body parts, movement duration, and dynamic quality
  * Develop an intermediary connection between the graphics engine and the new syntax
      * Have at least a prototype of how this sort of movement could be displayed through the graphics engine
      * Start the process of translating between the syntax and the coding that produces the 3d animation

To evaluate my language design, I will check to make sure it meets all of the requirements listed above. I will also check for characteristics like readability, not being overly verbose, and accurately translating to the simulation. To ensure that the language is high quality, I will make sure that it has opportunites to be extended. I also will try to do some user testing. It would be most effective to test with people with already know something about labanotation, though I'm sure I could still learn something from users who are non-familiar. 


## Implementation plan

In order to complete this project on time, I propose the following timeline (in addition to the documents required for class):
   * Sunday, April 3 - I will go through labanotation resources to identify the key symbols and structures so that I can be sure I know what all of the different types of movement ideas I need to cover are. In other words, I'll have a comprehensive list of the types of ideas that I need to express. I will choose the appropriate graphics engine.
   * Sunday, April 10 - For my prototype, I will have prerecorded examples of how the given syntax can translate into a simulation, given that I do not expect to have the connection between those two parts developed by then. I will have the first draft of the syntax developed at this point and be able to show something about what the actual simulation will eventually look like (note that this may not be actually coded by me at this point).
   * Sunday, April 17 - I will begin development of the IR section. I will also develop an example of how I can produce, through coding, a simulation in the chosen graphics engine.
   * Sunday, April 24 - I will finish connecting the syntax to the graphics engine so that the language is fully functional.

## Contingency plan
I believe that I should be able to get through the April 10 deadline without any issues. However, I do not know how well I will be able to complete the IR and actually finish the language in that respect. As such, my backup will just to be a proof of concept for that section, that displays how the syntax and graphics engine could actually connect. The less proof-of-concepty the better, although we'll see how difficult that part actually ends up being (as I am unfamiliar with 3d rendering, I don't have good time estimates for this section).
