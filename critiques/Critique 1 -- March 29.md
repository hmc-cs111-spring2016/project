## General Critique
I think I have a pretty good understanding of what you're trying to do, and after looking through your description.md and plans.md, it seems like you've done a thorough amount of research in terms of the technologies you need (which is super good). It's a great start, and probably puts you ahead of most of us (at least me), and will let you jump straight into the code this following week. It'll be a bit difficult I imagine writing the parser in a language you aren't exactly familiar with, but hopefully this extra time can help! In terms of the quality of the idea, I think the fact that others have done the same is a testament to the fact that people do use it, and it's a genuinely good idea. 

## Suggestions
It might be worth considering (maybe as a stretch goal) to have a few default options encompassed by a general "beginner" setting, or something of the sort in addition to just being able to define everything. We didn't really discuss this that thoroughly in class earlier this week, but if you were to implement the wildcard function that'd be a great addition and alternative to having this "beginner" setting. It'd be an easy way of having users who really don't care about a certain field (e.g. relative range). It's not mentioned in your plans or description, but I think that's a pretty interesting feature that would help you focus a bit more on language design rather than the back-end.

## Adding more Language Design Aspects
On a related note, one thing I brought up in class was that this project seems back-end heavy. At the same time, because the idea is ultimately data interpretation, I think it's actually pretty hard to include any more language design than what you've already laid out. The wildcard function is one idea that I thought would help bring more of the language design perspective to the project. I don't think it's a good idea to add control flow or other "language"-y aspects just for the sake of emphasizing language design -- I think it will detract a lot from the intentions of your DSL and just end up as an unnecessary aspect. Another suggestion that I had was perhaps adding some natural language syntax -- though I'm hesitant for the same aforementioned reason. At the moment, I think the sample syntax you've provided looks a lot like code, and I'm sure this was by design and not coincadental. As someone with a computer science background, this makes perfect sense to me, but perhaps to a musician this might not be ideal. If you could think of a novel way that perhaps musicians (your intended audience) can better fill out these parameters, that would be an awesome way to focus more on language design. I do like the error handling that you mentioned where your DSL would be able to prevent users from generated impossible syntax; I felt additions like these are good examples of things you want to consider to focus more on language design.
