I think your language is going to be extremely interesting. It has a very clear domain and it sounds like you have a  clear idea about what you are going to do at least in a broad sense. My biggest caution is that I think things are going to take longer than expected. As you discussed in your contingency plan, I think it would be wise to first focus on getting your language designed and working with at least the most basic syntax before you try to write the code that interfaces with the database, because that may take quite a while and you can have the basic framework of your language working even without that. I would say the same thing about the UI: to not worry about it until you have the basic syntax of your language designed and implemented, because that part seems more important.

One thing you will need to work out, perhaps in several iterations, is the right balance between allowing the users freedom to express their personal experience of a wine in their own words and narrowing down the syntax so that it is searchable. You don't want to limit your users too much, but if they have a sentence long description of the wine aroma, it will be difficult to search for that when you do database queries. 

One way you might try to balance these conflicting needs, would be if you created commands that took two arguments, the first being a specific, searchable keyword and the second being a sentence where they can expand on that, to explain in more detail. Something alonge the lines of flavor("raspberries", "like those raspberries we got when we visited grandpa's farm").

Another way to deal with this, would to create a limited set of keywords, especially for some of the simpler characteristics of a wine. For example, you could require that they label a wine's smoothness in one of a few predefined ways, this would then be much simpler to write querries about. This type of predefined vocabulary, might also decrease user frustration over searches. For example, if a user wanted to look up a raspberry flavored wine that they had tried a few months ago. It could be extremely frusterating if they have to remember if they described the flavor as "raspberry", "raspberries", "fresh raspberries", "Raspberries", "Raspberry" ect. something limitting the vocabulary they can use, seems like it would actually be to their benefit.

I'm not sure what the "right" answer is, but it seems like as you develope the syntax, you will also have to be developing a plan for how you will query things written in that syntax.

It seems like one thing that would be helpful for you to have by next week, is a list of the types of things you would like to be able to describe about a given wine, this will help you to think about how much vocab you are going to have to define, the types of things someone will be able to search the database for, and help Danial and I give you more specific feedback about those concrete things.
