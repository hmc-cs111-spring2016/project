## General Feedback:

Overall, I really like your plan and implementation so far. One of the things I was worried about for your project was how you would be able to get all the parts working - building scala projects alone is annoying at times. I also really like how you've specified the language goals both in person on Monday and in the sample program, so its clear that the language is oriented towards teaching people c-style programming in a fun way. I'd like to see at least a small example of the program working (probably just as an internal representation running in scala and on your server) so that its clear your project is feasible in the time frame we have, but overall I trust the research you've done, so it seems like you're on a good path. 

## Questions from the Implementation and plan:
- I like your sample program overall, and I think its consistent with your goals of teaching c-style programming. However, there are a few things that might seem redundant and pointless to someone learning to program. Specifically, as we talked about in class on Monday, the "void" keyword as the return type of your methods seems totally random out of context to a new programmer. Maybe having a different keyword here that was more descriptive, but did the same thing (something that specified that the method didn't return anything in spaceship-themed language). 
- This method of naming globals is good, as long as you clearly state that its what people have to do.
- I think the ```.``` operator is good, its faithful to c-style syntax (with structs in c and classes in c++), so again, as long as you're clear to the user. Function collisions should probably be an error, but with a clear error message.
- I have no idea, I'm terrible with version control issues like this :(
- I think you should commit asset files in the repo so that if someone wants to download your project and run it themselves, they can. Unless of course, you don't want people to be able to do that, in which case, probably not. 


##Specific suggestions:

I think there are two paths you can take with this project in the time that you have available, and both are very cool. The first path would be optimizing the project for lots of cool features and ways ot control the ships so that the game ends up very balanced and interesting. From what I've seen in the ship's API methods, its somewhat hard to write a legitimately good AI for the ship that does interesting things, which is totally fine. But, adding lots of builtin methods to do clever things could be a way to go that would be interesting from a language design perspective. The other path would be focusing on error messages and the feedback system primarily, and adding features later. I think this is more consistent with your educational goals, but I think to get it working will take quite a lot of design and work. You mentioned looking for a parser that had better error handling. I think - like we talked about in class - that a promising way to go is to actually include lots of common errors in your parse tree and handle them like that. This would allow you to use standard parser-combinators, but would require lots of thought regarding what errors are common and how to handle these. However, if you could do this well, it would be really awesome, and I could see it being a really effective way to learn and practice c-style coding in a fun environment. I'm excited!
