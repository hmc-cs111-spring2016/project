It seems like you have developed a pretty solid idea of what direction you want to take your project. I like it! However, it seems liek their are a few different ways you could scale your project. You asked for feedback on if you should implement a single SQL language or many. In my mind, it is all about the time trade offs. I would suggest that you first get your DSL fullying working for one SQL language, preferably one of the more popular, well-used ones, and then based on how much time you have, consider extending so that it works with other SQL languages, adding omre parts like the GROUPBY clauses you mentioned, or implement some error checking. 

I would guess you would have time to add more of one of those three things after you have the basic project working, but probably not time to do more languages, error checking, and clauses. I would suggest implementing the basic clauses, then a small amount of error checking and then possibly more clauses if you have time, because it seems more useful to have one very elegant, well-written piece of code even if its only useful in a smaller domain. However, that design decision seems that it could be put off until a little farther along in your project. 

You wrote in your response to last weeks critique that you wanted to use a standardization that all Scala users are already familiar with. However, I wonder if there are ways you might try to generalize it. You don't want to confuse people who are Scala users, but if this is supposed to be an easier way to write SQL queries, generic Scala code may not be the best way to accomplish that for users who are less familiar with Scala, and it would be neat to generalize it to reach a wider target audience. Are there Scala features you could use to remove some of the Scala "flavor" and make it a little bit more of a unique language within Scala?
