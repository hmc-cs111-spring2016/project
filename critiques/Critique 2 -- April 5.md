I agree that nailing down the specifics of the graphical part of your project should be a fairly high priority. It's a fairly risky part of the project because it might take a long time to get a good basic simulation up and running. I think you might want to prototype this fairly soon - see if you can get some kind of vpython program running where you can tell it something like "rotate the right arm by this amount" and it will display the result before and after, or an animation of it happening. Essentially, you should prototype the front-end (the gui) and the back-end (the vpython stuff) at the same time to make sure you're not missing any big picture things with either of them.

I know we discussed some of your ideas in class on monday and I do really like the idea of a gui for this - just make sure you know exactly what you are going to allow your users to do. I think the gui model pretty easily supports changing what the model looks like in real time. Are you going to allow your users to specify sequences of moves to carry out in rhythm? If so, then there will likely need to be some component other than the gui so that your program can automatically execute those commands sequentially. At the same time, really focus on what will make your system better than labanotation through ease of use. Another important thing to keep in mind is extensibility, especially if you don't get to everything you have slated - you want to make sure that someone else coming in to your project would be able to, for instance, define a time element if you don't put in that feature.

I think so long as you keep those tenets in mind going forward you should be fine. Unfortunately I haven't really done work in vpython or any other front-end in it since dabbling with it a tiny bit in cs5. 

Make sure your gui is self-explanatory, as well - some of the mockups you showed weren't entirely. Like, the having three arrows on each side of the box is a bit confusing. One way to do this is the thing I mentioned of putting pictures of body parts inside of the buttons to show which is which. Alternatively you could label them in some other way. But making sure that the gui is self-explanatory, is clear, and has an obvious mapping from buttons to the functionality of those buttons will be very important in distinguishing yourself from labanotation.
