In terms of how the user interacts with the language, I think in an ultimate finished form your language should not be interacted with via a terminal. My impression is that that wouldn't be a natural way for a middle-schooler who hasn't seen a terminal before to interact with it. Some kind of gui, where the user can paste in text or just directly type in a poem and click buttons, would be the ideal - you could have a main window for writing a poem, and have an auxiliary window or other small text box for specifying a rhyme scheme to check against, etc. You could then give graphical feedback by highlighting the lines or areas of the poem that are incorrect.

Now, obviously, I think a gui is stretching it for this project unless you really want to do it - but I think it would probably be the best way to interact with this language. The same can probably be said for a lot of things though (probably my language too, for instance, similar to ContextFree's gui) but it would be time you probably don't have. That said it's something to keep in mind. If you are using a terminal, you'll want some simple set of commands, I think. You'll want the error messages to not be things like "error on line 5" - they should be more informative, something like:

"A mistake was made - line 5 ('but it was too high') does not rhyme with line 3 ('you might ask, what did they say?'). Some suggestions: pie, nigh, fry, sty, guy."

And I mean, I just made that up on the spot. You can probably phrase that much more helpfully and maybe add some nice coloring to emphasize or differentiate the parts of it that are from their poem. But I think it'd be good to have something that either quotes the lines, or the ends of the lines, or something like that to give the user context, because I don't think a middle schooler or non-programmer will really be thinking of the third line of the poem as "line 3" of the poem. They'll be thinking of it as the line that says x. 

You really need to split your focus between two areas, ultimately - user experience and functionality. You can improve your user experience by doing things like more informative error messages, nicer interfaces for entering poems and rhyme schemes, etc. Be wary of making it feel like programming - I don't think programming in your DSL should feel like programming, so your terminal shouldn't really feel like a standard terminal and rhyme scheme specification shouldn't feel like creating regular expressions (which is partially a matter of just framing it as something else). But on the other end of things you'll also need to see how much power you can squeeze out of your regex model (or whatever model you decide to go with if it's something else). I think you can easily push in both of those directions in a number of different ways - it's just a matter of deciding what your priorities are. 

I think you'll want to come up with some list of bits of functionality that you think you want to implement (things like "be able to check if this line rhymes with the first line in its rhyming group" or "check if the poem has an appropriate number of lines") and implement as many as you can with informative error messages. Really, the more of these bits of functionality you implement, the better the language is. There is also the tradeoff that Prof. Ben mentioned of willingness to say things that might not actually be errors - you could also play with having some kind of a verbosity setting for that. 

This is kind of a lot of different pieces of advice everywhere since you said you weren't sure what you wanted advice on other than the method of interaction (which I think there are still a lot of options for). But really, so long as you prioritize well and put in the work, I think you're on track to have a solid project by the end.
