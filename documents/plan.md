# Project plan

## Language evaluation

*How will you know that your language has accomplished its goals? What tools, techniques, or measurements will you use to evaluate your language design? What tools or practices will you use to ensure that your language implementation is of high quality?*

I will know that my language has accomplished its goals if it could parallel a few basic functions of more established music editing software, namely Audacity given its more simplistic nature. One of the primary ways I hope to evaluate my language design is by trying to personally use it as well as asking peers who I know frequeuntly edit music using professional music editing software to provide some feedback with regards to feature differences and ease of use. I think the quality of my language implementation will come somewhat naturally considering the field of music editting is already relatively saturated with several tools. Doing anything less would be very obvious to both a trained and untrained eye. By constantly reminding myself of these completed tools, I hope to maintain a somewhat high quality language implementation.

## Implementation plan

*How much time do you think you'll need for the various components of your language (e.g., finding a host language, implementing the semantics, the parser, tools, etc)? Provide a brief schedule (e.g., with a deliverable every week) for your project.*

I've already more or less decided on the host language (Python). I feel like most of the time will be dedicated to deciding on semantics, actually implementing the semantics, and implementing the parser. Ideally I would want to provide some basic tools that will allow users to implement their own tools (e.g. define a new feature called amplify that increases bass and gain). Additional tools and perhaps a REPL interface could also be potential goals depending on how quickly the semantics and parser end up taking. 

Here is a tenative schedule:
Week 1: Finish project details and plan
Week 2: Final decision on host language, packages, and additional technology choices. Have a complete and sketched out idea of the syntax design. Decide on the basic music-editing tools that will be built in. 
Week 3: Have the semantics more or less done, start on the parser (if not complete)
Week 4: Finish the parser and begin implementing aforementioned stretch goals / REPL interface
Week 5: Finish any backlogged Work on presentation for DSL and any finishing touches

## Contingency plan

*What obstacles (technical and logistical) might you encounter while working on your project? How will you look out for them, overcome them, or work around them?*

I think most obstacles will end up being technical. I have a pretty good idea in terms of the logistics (overall language design) because I am using one of the ideas from my project proposal from earlier in the semester. (This idea has been brewing in my head for a while.) Because I don't plan on using Scala, I'm not sure about potential technical challenges that might come up. I know for Scala there were several syntactical and just language knowledge problems that came up when first learning, but hopefully documentation for Python will be more effective. However, I believe a lot of the past projects have also used Python, so they will be a useful resource in troubleshooting.
