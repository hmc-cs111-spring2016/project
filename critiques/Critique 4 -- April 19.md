I'm not entirely sure what you want feedback on here, so I'll just try to give as much high-level feedback as I can.

I definitely agree with the switch to JS, for a number of reasons (both you seeming more comfortable with it and the interface making more sense for this project). It seems like it'll be a lot easier to construct the kind of detailed gui with informative buttons that you want with JS rather than from scratch in Python. You should be able to sort most of the details out once you get a prototype working. 

I'm not sure exactly how much realism you're going to want with your 3d rendering. You could either go for something with a realistic or semirealistic skin texture, or just a correct shape without the texture. I'm not sure which a user of your language would find easier to work with. Some of the examples you showed were a bit unsettling, though. In an ideal world you might be able to provide both representations with an ability to toggle between them. Just make sure you get a good conceptual idea of exactly what your 3d model is supposed to be doing before delving into the deep specifics.

I imagine making a prototype shouldn't be too difficult so long as you partition your time well between focusing on the front and back ends. Just get something working for the front end (some simple mockup of buttons) and something working for the backend (some simple 3d mockup) and then add complexity as you go from there. It'll be a lot easier than trying to get either part perfect on the first try. Aside from that I don't think there's much other specific advice I can give.
