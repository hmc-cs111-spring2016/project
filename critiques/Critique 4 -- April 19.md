It looks like you are making lots and lots of technical progress, thats fantastic!  It also seems like you have a lot of ideas for more things you want to implement or be working on this week. One thing I would encourage you to take time for, is to step away from the computer for an hour or so and maybe map out on a white board what you have accomplished so far and what you are still hoping to accomplish. We don't have a lot of time left so I think it could be helpful to really work through what you believe a complete project looks like so you can try to complete that. Then you can always come back later and continue to work on your project to add in all the other features which you have been thinking about. 

I would invest some time in thinking about error checking to help your user debug if they make a mistake in their program. Because you are using Scala to write your programs there will be Scala error messages, but they might not always be the most helpful or instructive for someone to whom SQLTuple is a black box. I think especially at this point in the project your user experience is becoming very important and something you want to spend some time really considering. One related problem could be the determining if your methods are all safe because you want to make sure your users will not run into any unexpected problems. Make sure you have the syntax that you want for your user, and maybe just implement a few of the other functions you were considering, depending on time. You can always add them in later!

You asked specifically about creating a Student constructor in your notebook entry. To me, that seems like something you could add in later, but which isn't necessarily crucial now. Why would someone want to create a Student object outside of the class? How often do you imagine that a user might want to do this? How difficult would it be in those instances for them to just create the class instead and define the database fields inside the class. I would take sometime to really think about this before you invest a lot more time in it.

It seems like the issues you have run into with the filter method have been frusterating. I ran into several similar struggles this week with just trying to get all the pieces of my code to work correctly together. I wouldn't give up , but pay attention to how much time you invest intrying to get that one method working. Would it be better to simply forgo that method and instead work on one of the other methods you mentioned like foreach, sortBy, fold, or map.
