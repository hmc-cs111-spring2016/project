Based on our discussions in class and what I've read in your description/plan, it looks like you're off to a good start. 
The idea for the language itself is very clear, so you shouldn't have problems with trying to define the idea as much.
However, you don't have as many details in your implementation plan. It might be helpful to add more specifics to
some of your plans, so you're sure you have a clear grasp each week of what you should be doing. For example, how are you
planning to make your prototype?

As for the language, have you thought much yet about error messages, or what types of things would cause an error? Will you 
basically just stick with what context free does? I assume it would have to be extended somewhat because of the animation 
aspect--do you know what the additional possible errors could be?

Maybe this is too specific for the current phase of the project, but have you considered how the users will specify duration 
of the animation? Or speed of the different aspects of the animation? These types of considerations seem like the places where
you'll have to invent stuff beyond the context free paradigm, so it might be good to start considering them now.
