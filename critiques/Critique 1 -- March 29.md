I think this is a really solid idea for a project, if largely scoped. My favorite things about this project is that it seems to fill a very specific and important need to a very specific target audience. In my opinion, this makes things easier for you as it's easier to keep their desires in mind. You are also part of the target audience which makes that even easier. I like that you are taking an existing, faulty complex language (arguably DSL!) and making it easier to use and understand.

I think syntax is going to be a really interesting decision going forward. How much flexibility do you want to give the users to deviate from Labanotation, or say the same thing in different ways? For example, is "up and left" the same and "left and up"? If not, how do you communicate to the user what the ordering actually means? If yes, how do you inform the user what the ordering means? I do like your suggestions on catching errors and it's obvious to me that you have a good idea of what you want things to look like. Also, what kind of syntax will you use for "quickly" vs "slowly"? Will that be in English, or a numerical slider?

My other big concern is about animation. Maybe it's colored a little too much by my own experiences, but I've always found that animations can be extremely cumbersome to get off the ground and work with. I think your plan is pretty good in terms of accounting for that, but this is something that I can see being a potential sinkhole. Be careful! I would get started playing around with the graphics engine you choose by this first deadline (April 3) as well, but totally up to you. I think you have a pretty good idea of what is required here.

As Josh mentioned in his critique to me, I don't know much about good practices as far as using API's in DSLs (and projects of this magnitude in general). I'll try to make sure we discuss our shared challenges in critique group meetings, so that we don't get stuck with anything small and technical for too long. I wonder what the smaller "hang-ups" or details could make this project more challenging than it seems -- perhaps things like 3d rendering, or working with a graphics engine. For example, at what point is a 3d rendering of a person's movement considered "good enough" to appropriately describe the motion desired?

Overall, I think this is a really cool idea. As long as you are really deliberate about your syntax choices, and keep yourself (and your target audience) in mind, you could make something here that's really exciting and useful.
