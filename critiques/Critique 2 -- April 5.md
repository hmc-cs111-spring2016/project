### Comments on your Syntax Design

* In class and in your notbebook you talked a lot about VexTab and in general syntax design. To reiterate what I said in class, I think the best way to approach the prototype coming up is to take, for now, the syntax from VexTab for the most basic functions you need in your DSL and to create a parser and intermediate representation for that. This will make it easier to test whether or not your parser and intermediate representation actually works. Additionally, I think you should definitely consider simply outputting the raw text that Lilypond takes in, and test by manually inputting said text into Lilypond, to avoid any potential problems with transpiling to Lilypond. Because automating the transpiling from Lilypond to MIDI or whatever file type you might want will probably just be a bash script, I think it's best to focus your efforts on the more language-design-oriented aspects for now and get that working. I also think its worth mentioning that it might be benefecial to have a concrete syntax design in your mind when you start writing the parser. Think back to the Piconot lab. For me, personally, I felt that designing the syntax and programming the parser to be as close to said designed syntax ultimately made the DSL implemented more true to the original intentions, if that makes sense. 

* As to my thoughts on the VexTab syntax, I actually find it pretty easy to understand. I think at the very least, you can take how the tabstave is intialized as well as how the key and time are defined. You mentioned in class that the way VexTab handles tuples with ^x^ was significantly easier than how Lilypond handles it. While I agree, I think it would be easier to implement this syntax, or something similar, but have it be a prefix rather than a postfix. I'm not entirely sure how VexTab works, but implementing this feature as a prefix might be a bit easier in my opinion. So, for instance, rather than having the user write "5s7s8/5 ^3^" the user would write "^3^ 5s7s8/5." 

* I think it's also a good idea to focus on compiling to Lilypond from your DSL for now. I think it might be a bit ambitious to try to also work with TuxGuitar. If I understand correctly, it seems like you would have to transpile what the user writes in your DSL to Java and then feed it to TuxGuitar. Given how different the transpile processes are between Lilypond and TuxGuitar, I would focus on one for now. 

* I really like the detailed evaluation plan you provided! It definitely will give you a standard to hold your DSL to at the end of the semester!

### Other Comments

* You mentioned earlier that your DSL would be targetted at someone who has some experience working with guitar tabs (your domain). As someone who has never played guitar or worked with guitar tabs, I think even the syntax VexTab provides can be a bit intimidating. This might be worth considering if you plan on expanding your domain. It seems like the purpose of your DSL is to make creating guitar tab a more fluid and seamless experience. I definitely think VexTab is a significant improvement to Lilypond; however, perhaps your DSL can provide an even more creative syntax design that can allow even people like me to create guitar tabs! 

* As I am also using Python as my host language, I'd looking into pyparsing if you still haven't found something to use for parsing. The documentation is pretty thorough, and it seems like a popular choice for those trying to create an external DSL (this means there's a lot of support and existing questions to troubleshoot any problems!).
