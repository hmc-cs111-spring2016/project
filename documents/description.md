# Project description

## Motivation

Labanotation exists as commonly method used for notating movement. However, the language itself can be cumbersome and complicated to write and read. This makes it unaccessible to those who do not have serious training in transcribing and interpreting movement in Labanotation. As such, it would be beneficial to the movement analysis community to develop a language that retains the specifity of Labanotation while reducing the complexity. With this in mind, it would be useful to develop a language in which users can write out movement and see a simulation of that movement. Doing so would help both avoid the complexity of Labanotation and allow the user to see what their movement ideas look like in close to real time. 

## Language domain

As mentioned in the motivation, the domain of this language is movement transcription. This domain is useful as it helps both choreographers and dancers to easily record movement and revisit that movement. It is also useful to other performers and non-dancers as a way to understand how we move and interact with the world. 

As far as I can tell, there are few other DSL's for this domain. One of the best known ones is DanceForms (see http://www.charactermotion.com/), which was often used by modern choreographer Merce Cunningham. However, as far as I can tell, this software is not well maintained. Another popular movement software is Isadora (see http://troikatronix.com/). However, it looks like this is more for use in projections with dance rather than simulation of dance movement. There seem to be quite a few straight Labanotation softwares, but they don't seem to deal with the problem of Labanotation's complexity. Looking into DanceForms to see how it does simulations may be useful. It could also be useful to see if any of the Labanotation programs have API's with which I could interface after developing my syntax.
